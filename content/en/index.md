If you would like to help us with the workshops or with the set-up/organisation, simply send us an email to hotb@chaostreff-flensburg.de. The event depends on the support of volunteers.

### Can I come along to simply meet new people or work on my own project?

By all means! That's exactly what our events are all about: tinkering, crafting, working on your own projects that you don't have time for at home and gathering new inspiration in the process. Another point is to make new contacts and get to know people. If you would like to bring something bigger than just your laptop and Arduino (etc.), please send us a short email in advance: hotb@chaostreff-flensburg.de.

### Travelling

#### Bus

It is also possible to take bus number 7 to the bus stop "Flensburg Twedter Feld". From there it is approx. 20 minutes on foot to the beach pavilion. There is a night bus service from Twedter Plack. The last bus N2 leaves at 03:16 from Twedter Plack to e.g. Flensburg ZOB.
You can find the bus connections in Flensburg in the DB-Navigator or at [nah.sh](https://www.nah.sh/de/fahrplan/planer/). A live location of the buses can be found at [busradar-flensburg](https://www.busradar-flensburg.de/).
FlixBus travels from most major cities in Germany (Kiel, Hamburg, Bremen, Hanover, Berlin,...) and Denmark (Aarhus, Copenhagen, Kolding,...). All connections end at the railway station in Flensburg. With Sydtrafik there is also a Danish provider that stops at the ZOB. It is about 30 minutes by bike from the railway station to Hacks on the Beach. By bus, it is approx. 5 minutes from the ZOB to the railway station.

#### Train
There are various train connections ~~ from Kiel (approx. 1 hour) and ~~ from Hamburg (approx. 2 hours) by regional train. There is often even mobile internet and power sockets on the trains. You should not rely on mobile internet and enjoy the digital detox. Occasionally, Danish ICs also run from Hamburg to Flensburg. There is a daily EC connection from Prague to Flensburg. For groups without a â‚¬49 ticket, the Schleswig-Holstein ticket from Hamburg is worthwhile. You can buy Sparpreis tickets via detours, which are also worthwhile due to the high regional train prices. You can travel from Denmark with the Danish State Railway.
